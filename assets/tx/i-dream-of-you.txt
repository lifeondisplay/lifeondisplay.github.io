(hey...)
(i'm kind of glad you didn't pick up)
(i kind of just called to hear your voice so...)
(your voice recording was enough)
(i should hang up, what am i doing?)
(so, if- i feel kind of dumb)
(but, uh...)
(i miss you)
(i've been thinking about you)
(i've been thinking about our love)
(and how much i miss your touch)
(i miss being around you)
(hearing your laugh and holding your hand)
(i think of you every day)
(i hope and i wish that you're doing ok)
(i want us to go back to the old days)
(because, i miss you)
(and i just thought of you so i thought i'd call you)
(to tell you that...)
(you crossed my mind and i took that as a sign that...)
(i should call and say)
("hi")
(so that's all.)
(hi...)
(i hope you don't think i've lost my mind)
(i hope you don't think i'm crazy)
(this message is getting long so...)
(i should just say bye but............................)
